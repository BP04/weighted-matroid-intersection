# weighted-matroid-intersection

This repository is created as part of IF1220 - Discrete Mathematics Assignment. I wrote a paper about matroid intersection and its application on network design.
The problem used as benchmark for the program is [DIY Tree](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1556/H).

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run C++ code on IDE.

## File Description

- DIYTree.cpp contains the solution to problem [DIY Tree](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1556/H).
- count_forest.cpp provides a function to count number of forest over $N$ nodes.
- main.cpp contains a program that builds the optimal degree-constrained minimum spanning tree given the graph and constraints.
